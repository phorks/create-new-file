# Create New Files

Allows creating files and folders through a popup.

There are already many alternatives, each falling short of my expectations:

1. The popup must be a single step dialog (the target folder and file must be accepted in the same dialog)
1. Use the folder of the active document by default and allow addressing via the workspace root
